# Tax-Fraud-Detection
## Tax fraud detection in a New York City (NYC) real estate dataset.
<hr />

### Background
In this project, we analyze New York City’s (NYC’s) real estate data to specifically identify property tax fraud. The main indicators of property tax fraud were property tax assessments that were too high or too low (outlier values). The dataset contains more than a million records, with 32 features. Our goal is to use statistical models in an unsupervised manner to detect outlier records (potentially fraudulent).
